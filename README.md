# Potable-Weight-Machine-for-Trolley
The accurate measurement of vehicle weights is crucial for various sectors, including transportation, logistics, and road safety. Traditional weighing methods often involve stationary weighbridges, which are expensive to install, require significant space, and lack mobility. The primary goal of our project is to create a Portable Trolley Weight Measurement Machine that offers a convenient and reliable method for determining the weight of loaded trolleys using a suspension of spring. 
The most common definition of weight found in introductory physics textbooks defines weight as the force exerted on a body by gravity. In this project we are going to work on the spring suspension principle, movement detected by laser instrumentation, As the spring gets compressed the laser detects movement and passes the signal further. The change in load per unit of deflection is generally expressed in pounds per inch. Spring rate is determined by the amount of force, in pounds, in kilograms required to constrict a spring by one inch or centimeters. ![image](https://github.com/PrathmeshMane41/Potable-Weight-Machine-for-Trolley/assets/169891067/4a341c03-49eb-4882-a875-767f649963ca)
Our device is among the most generic and cheap of equipment of the sensitivity and reliability system. Regular monitoring of weight on LCD displays not only gives proper and accurate measurement but also adds to increased sustainability. The Arduino Uno-based monitoring of weight is useful as compared to manual weight measurement and also it is reliable as it is not possible to monitor manually, under bad conditions, overload conditions, or voltage. Bluetooth is undergoing connection from the message sent to mobile. We can recover the system in less time.
The proposed result system has shown that the system works well with accuracy, and the sensitivity of the scheme is very high in illegal and error situations. Monitoring weight will help identify or detect unforeseen conditions before any major failures lead to greater reliability and cost savings. If the device is in a strange state, we know the accurate weight of the filled trolley. No manual method is required to calculate after this amazing device.
