# Potable-Weight-Machine-for-Trolley
The accurate measurement of vehicle weights is crucial for various sectors, including transportation, logistics, and road safety. Traditional weighing methods often involve stationary weighbridges, which are expensive to install, require significant space, and lack mobility. The primary goal of our project is to create a Portable Trolley Weight Measurement Machine that offers a convenient and reliable method for determining the weight of loaded trolleys using a suspension of spring. 
The most common definition of weight found in introductory physics textbooks defines weight as the force exerted on a body by gravity. In this project we are going to work on the spring suspension principle, movement detected by laser instrumentation, As the spring gets compressed the laser detects movement and passes the signal further. The change in load per unit of deflection is generally expressed in pounds per inch. Spring rate is determined by the amount of force, in pounds, in kilograms required to constrict a spring by one inch or centimeters. If the rate of the spring is linear, its rate is not affected by the load that is put on the spring. ![image](https://github.com/PrathmeshMane41/Potable-Weight-Machine-for-Trolley/assets/169891067/4a341c03-49eb-4882-a875-767f649963ca)
CHAPTER â€“ 4
Result  

For Observation analysis, consider 1 brick of 5 kg which we weighed on an electronic weighing machine and it shows accurate weight like electronic weight.
